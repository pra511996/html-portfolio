<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Prachi, and I live in Hanover, Maryland, USA. I am a Computer Science graduate 
from University of Maryland Global Campus. I'm a movie enthusiast who loves exploring different 
genres and storytelling styles. When I'm not watching movies, I enjoy reading books, 
traveling, and spending time with friends and family. 
I'm always on the lookout for new films to add to my watchlist.</p>

<p>A little more if I add will be that I was born and raised in India. I have completed my schooling
there before moving to the USA for higher education with my family. I had a passion of biotechnology
and wanted to pursue my career in that field initially. However, my relatives suggested pharmacy and went to UMES
for doctorate degree after completing Associate. Due to satying away from home and home cooked
food, I fall ill and had to take a drop.
</p>

<p>After that I got a job in governmnent sector as a solid state technician.
So, decided to switch my field to computer science as it is a growing field. I have always been
interested in technology and problem solving, so computer science seemed like a natural fit for me.
Hope find an better job and growth in this field.</p>
